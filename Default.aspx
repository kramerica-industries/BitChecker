    <h1>Trust Us With Your Bits</h1>
    <p><b>Not all bits are 1’s or 0’s.</b> As computer processors become more powerful and memory capacity grows, defects in hardware manufacturing have introduced a rare phenomenon known as “rogue bits.” These bits are neither one nor zero, but lie in-between or beyond. What really matters, though, is the threat they pose.  </p>
    <p><b>Rogue bits spread like a virus, only worse.</b> Most software was never designed to handle rogue bits. As such, when a rogue bit is encountered, these programs will crash and may even add rogue bits to other memory. Here’s how.  </p>
    <p><b>BitChecker can help.</b> Using our Patent Pending technology, we can ensure that all of your files contain only 1’s and 0’s. <em>You can Trust Us With Your Bits</em>&trade;.</p>
    <p><b>Try it out for free.</b> Best of all, during our beta period, we are offering BitScan entirely free. It’s a safe and easy way to make sure your bits are 1’s and 0’s.</p>
